			"bio": "Reihaneh received her bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran in 2016. Following graduation, she moved to Austin, Texas to attend graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin. In May 2018, she received her master's degree in geotechnical engineering under the supervision of Dr. Stokoe. Her master's research involved field and laboratory dynamic testing of soil and rock. She is currently pursuing her PhD under the supervision of Dr. Stokoe and Dr. Kumar. Her PhD research is in the area of computational geomechanics. She greatly enjoys working at UT and she hopes to pursue a career in academia after graduation. Her goal as the president of Geo-Institute is to make the graduate school experience as enjoyable as possible for the geotechnical graduate students."
