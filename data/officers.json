			"bio": "Mrunmay joined the University of Texas at Austin for a master's degree in Geotechnical Engineering in January 2021 and his research focuses on developing guidelines for risk assessment for buried submarine cables, under the supervision of Dr. Robert B. Gilbert. He completed his undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from University of Pune in August 2018, following which he worked with Central Water and Power Research Station where he worked on physical and computational modeling to assess performance of orifice type spillways of dams for multiple hydropower projects on Himalayan Rivers. Shortly after, he worked with Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay as researcher on reduction of lateral thrust on retaining structures using compressible inclusions, which piqued his interest in Geotechnical Engineering. He aims to work in industry upon completion of the program. In spare time he tries to learn about different cultures and enjoys spending time in nature. He is also an avid photographer.The Geo-Institute Student Chapter at the University of Texas at Austin is one of the aspects that sets the Geotech Program apart from others. With the GI team, Mrunmay will work on building a strong community of geotech students that is involved in activities which expose them to industry practices and field realities by engaging industry partners and an extensive alumni network."

			"bio": "Audrey received her bachelor’s degree in Geology from Texas A&M University in May 2017. After graduation, she worked for a tunnel construction company as a field engineer. She was involved with the 5 mile long, hard rock TBM tunnel for the Atlanta Water Supply project. Then, she started and completed the SAWS Central Water Integrated Pipeline Segment 5-1 project in San Antonio which consisted of two hard rock TBM tunnels, a hand-mine tunnel and one open cut section. This field experience motivated her to pursue a master’s degree in Geotechnical Engineering which she started in August 2020 at the University of Texas at Austin. She has really enjoyed being involved with the Geo-Institute student chapter at UT and hopes this organization enhances the graduate student experience for geotechnical engineering students. Audrey plans to continue in the heavy civil industry with a focus in tunnels in her future career. "

Bench-scale experimental approaches are adopted by which geomaterials are used to stabilize/contain heavily contaminated soils.Hassan graduated from the Lebanese American University in Lebanon with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering (2019) and a master's degree in engineering mechanics (2021). Throughout that period, Hassan served as an active member in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE - LAU Chapter), LAU consultants and Engineers without borders. In his role as a secretary of the Geo-Institute Student Chapter at the University of Texas at Austin, Hassan is looking forward to aid in building a stronger Geotech community among the graduate students."
